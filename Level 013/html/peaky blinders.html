        <P>The Peaky Blinders is the most powerful gang in England, and one of the most powerful 
            gangs in the world. Initially founded in Birmingham after WWI, through Thomas Shelby's 
            leadership, they began as an illegal bookmaking operation and eventually 
            branched out to fixing races, bootlegging and car manufacturing.
            They were established as the Shelby Company Limited in 1920. However,
             after the Wall Street Crash they began switching bootlegging to smuggling opium in order to raise enough
              capital to keep the company from going bankrupt. They have various legitimate businesses such as a distillery,
               automotive manufacturing factories, racetracks, etc.</P>
                <hr>
               <p>Their rise to power was aided through Thomas Shelby's brains and initiative
                , and his transactional relationship with Winston Churchill
                , as Thomas kept doing favors for him and the Crown such as assassinations, arms deals
                , and gathering intelligence on radical political groups in England and abroad. Winston Churchill
                 eventually repaid the favor by granting him an Empire export license to sell manufactured car parts
                  to power when he asked Churchill for an OBE, and ran for MP of Birmingham, eventually winning by 
                  a landslide, due to his considerable influence in the city.</p>
