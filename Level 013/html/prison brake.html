   <p>Prison Break is an American crime drama television series created by Paul Scheuring 
    for Fox. The series revolves around two brothers: Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and
     Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller); Lincoln has been sentenced to death for a crime he d
     id not commit, while Michael devises an elaborate plan to help his brother escape prison an
     d clear his name. Along with creator Paul Scheuring, the series is executive-produced by Mat
     t Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Marty Adelstein, Dawn Parouse, Neal H. Moritz, and Brett Ratner who di
     rected the pilot episode. The series' theme music, composed by Ramin Djawadi, was nominated for
     a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006.[1] Prison Break is a joint production between Original Film, Ade
     lstein/Parouse Productions (seasons 1–4), Dawn Olmstead Productions (season 5), Adel
    stein Productions (season 5), One Light Road Productions (season 5) and 20th Cent
    ury Fox Television, and is syndicated by 20th Television.</p>

        The series was originally turned down by Fox in 2003, which was concerned about the 
        long-term prospects of such a series. Following the popularity of serialized prime time
         television series Lost and 24, Fox decided to back production in 2004. The first season 
         received mostly positive reviews from critics with universal acclaim from audiences.[2] Fu
         rthermore, it performed exceptionally in the ratings and was originally planned for a 13-epis
         ode run, but was extended to include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity. The subse
         quent seasons continued to receive strong ratings, however some critics claimed the show had 
         overstayed its welcome.[3] Prison Break was nominated for several industry awards, including t
         he 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Drama and the 2006 People's Choice Award for Favori
        te New TV Drama, which it won. In the United States, all five seasons have been released on DVD and released on Blu-ray internationally.</p>

  <p>The success of the series has spawned several official tie-ins: a video game, the spin-off series Prison
     Break: Proof of Innocence for mobile phones, online webisodes, an official magazine, and a novel. The fo
     urth season of Prison Break returned from its mid-season break in a new 
    timeslot on April 17, 2009, for the series' last six episodes.[4] Two additional episodes, titled "Th
    e Old Ball and Chain" and "Free" were produced, and were later transformed into a standalone feature, ti
    tled The Final Break. Its events take place before the last scene of the series finale, and conclude the 
    plotlines. The feature was released on DVD and Blu-ray July 21, 2009.[5]
    A nine-episode fifth season was announced by Fox in January 2016. The revival se
    ries premiered on April 4, 2017, and concluded on May 30.[6] In January 2018, Fox c
    onfirmed that season 6 was in early development;[7] however, in August 2019, Fox anno
    nced that it had no current plans to revive Prison Break,[8] with Miller stating in lat
    e 2020 that he had no plan to return to the series.[9]</p>
