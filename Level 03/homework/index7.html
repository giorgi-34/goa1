<P>Basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield,
     Massachusetts, by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as a less injury-prone sport than football.
      Naismith was a 31-year-old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.
      [1] The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, 
      first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges,
       the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946,
        grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.</P>

<P>A game similar to basketball is mentioned in a 1591 book published in Frankfurt am Main that reports on the lifestyles and customs of coastal North American residents, Wahrhafftige Abconterfaytung der Wilden.[2] Among other things, a game of skill is described in which balls must be thrown against a target woven from twigs, mounted high on a pole in the middle of a large playing field. There's a small reward for the player if the target is being hit.[3]

    The game of basketball as it is known today was created by Dr. 
    James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts,
     to condition young athletes during cold months.
      Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School 
      (now known as Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss,
       Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.
       [1] It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game.
        He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game.
         The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony.
          Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, 
          the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.</P>
