                        never written a line ot code. I needed
                        some structure from professionals
                        can help me learn prograrnminq
                        Stop by Step. I Was encouraged to
                        enrou by a former student Of theirs
                        who can only say wonderful things
                        *rout the progratn. The entire
                        curriculum and staff did not
                        &sappoint. They were very hands-on
                        and I never had to wait long for
                        assistance. Ihe agile team project, in
                        particular. was outstanding. It took
                        my learning to the next level in a way
                        that no tutorial could ever have. In
                        fact. rye often referred to it during
                        interviews as an example of my
                        developent experience. It certainly
                        land a job as a full-stEk
                        developer after receiving rmßtiple
                        offers. 100% recommend!
