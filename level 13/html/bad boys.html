In June 2008, Michael Bay stated that he might direct Bad Boys for Life,
 but that the greatest obstacle to the potential sequel would be the cost, 
 as he and Will Smith demand some of the highest salaries in the film industry.[
    1] By August 2009, Columbia Pictures had hired Peter Craig to write the script 
    for Bad Boys III.[2] In February 2011, Martin Lawrence reiterated that the film 
    was in development.[3] In June 2014, Jerry Bruckheimer announced that screenwriter
     David Guggenheim was working on the storyline for the sequel.[4] Two months later,
      Lawrence said a script had been written and parts had been cast.[5] By June 2015,
       director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film.[
        6] Two months later, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced that Bad Boys III would be
         released on February 17, 2017. On March 4, 2016, the film was pushed to June 2, 2017
         .[7] Producers had planned to begin production in early 2017.[8]</P>

        In January 2020, a fourth film entered development, with Chris Bremner serving as screenwriter.
         Smith and Lawrence will reprise their roles from the previous three movies.[23] In April 2022,
          production for the film was reportedly halted due to the incident with Smith slapping Chris
           Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards ceremony and the subsequent investigation.[24] In February 
           2023, Smith announced that the fourth film was in pre-production.[25] That same month,
            it was reported by musician/disc jockey Questlove that Smith had to drop out of a planned
             surprise appearance at the 65th Grammy Awards because filming for the fourth Bad Boys film 
             had started earlier that week.[26] Principal photography began on April 3, 2023 in Atlanta,
              Georgia.[27] The film was released in the United States on June 6, 2024.[28</P>
