            In small-town Florida, Chris is working at a car wash
             when a woman, Maria, arrives. Chris tells the man whose car he's washin
             g that she is his high school crush. He begins to vacuum the car, but th
             e overpowered vacuum sucks his clothes off, leaving him naked. He panics and hides in the ca
            r. The man has a conversation with Maria, attempting to get her number for Chris, but she declines and leaves.
            Chris' best friend, Bud, is working at a computer shop, where his sister, Tri
            na, pulls up in her car. After having a conversation with two customers, she b
            egs Bud for money, but he refuses. Although on house arrest, she robs the store
             and removes her ankle monitor, gives money to the two customers, warning them n
             ot to snitch. Later, Chris and Bud talk about Trina, Maria, and going on big adventures.

        <p> One year later, a plumber enters Chris' house 
            and Chris surprises him by rising from a bathtub full of beer 
            cans. Chris realises he's late and runs to his new job at a smoot
            hie shop, causing chaos along the way. Maria enters the shop, and t
            hey have a conversation,
             where she reveals she runs an art gallery in New York City. She gi
             ves him her card for the gallery. Looking at the card causes him t
             o lose focus and accidentally catch his hand in a smoothie blender, splattering 
             blood everywhere.
           He later asks advice from an old man, who tells him to follow Maria
            to New York. Chris then sings a musical number called "I Saw a Girl
             Today" to the confusion of everyone around him. Talking with Bud on
              the bus, they make the ultimate plan for a road trip to New York. 
              Chris gets the idea to steal Trina's car, which Bud first opposes, but Chris reminds him th
              at Trina's in jail.</p>

            Bud pays to remove the car from impound. Meanwhile, Trina escapes from jail. 
            She finds out her car was taken and plans to kill Bud and Chris, stealing a p
            olice car to hunt them down. Chris and Bud wreck a gas station pump, go drinkin
            g at a "redneck" bar where Chris vomits uncontrollably and falls off a high led
            ge after having too many shots, and visit a zoo where Chris is raped by
             a gorilla after breaking into its enclosure to take a selfie with it.
         They later crash Trina's car and get into a big argument, ending their frie
         ndship, until an ROTC recruiter tells Chris some words of wisdom. Chris finds 
         Bud on a bus back to Florida, and they make up, finally making it to Maria's art
          gallery. Trina sees her damaged car and finding Maria’s business card covered w
          ith Chris' blood, she continues to hunt them down. After Chris declares his lov
          e for Maria, she rejects him before Trina drives through the art gallery wall, attacking Chris with various pieces of art.</p>
