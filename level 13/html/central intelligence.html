    <p>In 1996, star athlete Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner is being h
        onored at his school, Central High. Halfway through his speech, a 
        group of bullies led by Trevor Olson throws the morbidly obese nerd 
        Robbie Weirdicht (who was taking a shower and dancing happily to "My 
        Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)" on a radio in the boys’ locker room) naked into
         the gymnasium in the middle of an assembly. Everyone starts laughing ex
         cept for Joyner and his girlfriend, Maggie Johnson, who are the only ones
          sympathetic towards Weirdicht; the former even going as far as to quickly
           cover him with his varsity jacket in a moment of compassion. He thanks Joyner and flees in humiliation and embarrassment.
        Twenty years later, Joyner is married to Maggie and works as a forensic accou
        ntant, but is dissatisfied with his career. She suggests they see a therapist 
        to salvage their deteriorating marriage. At work, Joyner receives a friend requ
        est on Facebook from "Bob Stone", who invites him to meet at a bar. Stone reveal
        s himself to be Weirdicht, who has transformed into a muscular, fit, confident man
         with advanced hand-to-hand combat skills.

        <p> After a bar fight and tour of the school, Stone as
            ks Joyner to review some online transactions, and he disco
            vers a multimillion-dollar auction with bidders from radical 
            countries, with the final bids set to conclude the following day. 
            The next morning, a team of CIA agents led by Pamela Harris arrives at
             Joyner's in search of Stone, who shockingly vanished after sleeping on Joyner’s
             couch. Harris tells Joyner that he is a dangerous rogue agent who murdered his f
             ormer partner, Phil Stanton.</p>
             <hr>
             <p> Harris tells Joyner tha
                t Stone intends to sell satellite codes to the highe
                st bidder. Soon after Stone abducts him, explaining tha
                t he is trying to stop a mysterious criminal called the "Blac
                 Badger" from selling the codes but needs Joyner's skills to locate the 
                 meeting place. After an attack by a bounty hunter, Joyner flees and cal
                 ls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the marriage counselor's office. 
                 Harris intercepts him, telling him that Stone is the Black Badger. She 
                 warns him to not tell Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Stone's location.
              Joyner meets Maggie for their marriage counseling session, where Stone is p
              osing as the counselor. Stone convinces Joyner to help him, so he sets up
               a meeting with Olson, who can track the offshore account for the auction t
               o get the deal's location. Olson feigns an apology for bullying Stone befo
               re once again antagonizing him. Harris calls Joyner and threatens to arres
               t Maggie if he fails to help them detain Stone. Joyner reluctantly betrays
                him, and the CIA arrests him.</p>
