    Fast & Furious, also known as The Fast and the 
    Furious, is a media franchise centered on a series of ac
    tion films that are largely concerned with street racing, 
    heists, spies, and family. The franchise also includes short f
    ilms, a television series, toys, video games, live shows, and theme
     park attractions. The films are distributed by Universal Pictures.
    The first film, based on the 1998 Vibe magazi
    ne article "Racer X" by Ken Li and written by Gary Sc
    ott Thompson, Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer, was released in 2001. It began the original tetralogy of 
    films focused on illegal street racing, which culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series 
    moved towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011), which was follow
    ed by five sequels in that genre, the most recent of
     which, Fast X, was released on May 19, 2023.</p>

    bbs & Shaw (2019), while its subsidiary DreamWorks Animation followed this with the 
    six-season animated streaming television series Fast & Furious Spy Racers (2019–2021).
     Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums
      containing existing music heard in the films. Two short films that tie into the series 
      have also been released.
    The series has been commercially successful. It is 
    's biggest franchise and the eighth highest-grossing film series, with a combined gross of 
    over $7 billion.[2] Critical reception for the first four films was mixed until the fifth and 
    later films, which were more positively received. Outside of the films, Fast & Furious has been
     the focus of other media, including attractions at Universal Stud</p>
