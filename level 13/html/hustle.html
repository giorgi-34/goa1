        Plot</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Stanley Sugerman, a jaded international sc
            out for the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA, 
            lives life on the road searching for future stars. His f
            requent travel takes a toll on his wife Teresa and daughter Alex. Wh
            ile he is liked by 76ers owner Rex Merrick, he clashes with Rex's son 
            Vincent. Rex promotes Stanley to assistant coach, allowing him to remain 
            at home with his family. The same evening, however, Rex dies, leaving Vin
            ce in charge. Three months later, Vince demotes Stanley again to scout, s
            ending him overseas. His former college teammate Leon Rich encourages him
             to leave the 76ers and also become a player agent. When Stanley's plan to s
            cout a player in Spain falls through, watching a local pick-up game, he is
             stunned by an incredibly talented unknown player.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stanley attempts to speak with the man, Bo Cruz, but is rebuffed unti
    l he makes a FaceTime call to Dirk Nowitzki to prove his legitimacy. Bo
     and his mother Paola recount his life story: he was a talented player 
     from an early age and was invited to play in America at age 15, but st
     ayed in Spain after his girlfriend became pregnant with his daughter L
     ucia. Bo now works construction and makes extra money hustling at bask
     etball. After an impressive workout with members of the Spanish nation
     al team, Stanley urges the 76ers front office to sign Cruz immediately,
      but Vincent is unconvinced. Taking matters into his own hands, Stanley
       pays to bring Cruz to the US, telling him he will be signed by the Si
       xers or enter the NBA draft. At the airport, Bo is detained for an ag
       gravated assault conviction he received in Spain. He is released
    , but warned that he could be deported if he were to be arrested in America.</p>
