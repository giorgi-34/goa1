    <p>In Harlem, Dax Winslow is the underappreciated basketball coach of the Harlem 
        Money and their star player, Casper Jones. Dax spends lavishly to keep both 
        his girlfriend, Jess, and Casper happy, despite being a clerk at Foot Locker.
         During practice Mookie Bass, Dax's longtime rival, arrives and taunts him about
          the upcoming Rucker Classic. In a dream sequence, it is revealed that Dax wa
        s an orphan who planned on becoming a basketball player, but was humiliated
         by Mookie after he had a shot blocked by him in their youth. The next day at 
         work Casper demands expensive new shoes from Dax, who effectively bankrupts hims
         elf purchasing them. Despite this, Mookie successfully recruits Casper and the rest 
         of Dax's team away from him, leading to a confrontation involving Dax forcibly trying 
         to remove Casper's shoes that is filmed and shown on ESPN. Due to this humiliation, Jess
          dumps him and kicks him out of her apartment.
        Dejected, Dax has little luck finding players for a new team until the cantankerous Angelo
         encourages him to seek out Uncle Drew, a well-remembered streetball legend who, along with 
         his team, disappeared after missing the finals of the 1968 Rucker. After seeing a demonstrat
         ion of Drew's prowess, Dax recruits him for the team, neglecting to inform him about the priz
         e money. Drew agrees to join Dax under the condition that they recruit his original teammates.</p>

        <p>Returning to Rucker Park, Drew gives
             each member of his team gear that restores their faith 
             and abilities, but Big Fella still refuses to cooperate with Drew. Du
             ring the first round, Big Fella and Drew tussle on the court, almost cos
             ting the team the win. Eventually, Drew acknowledges his mistake: sleepin
             g with Big Fella's late wife before the big game. He admits that he too loved her and the two make amends.

            Meanwhile, Dax learns that Mookie and Jess are dating, and begins falling f
            or Maya. After learning about the tournament's prize money from Angelo, Dre
            w angrily confronts Dax for misleading him. Dax confides in him about his pas
            t with Mookie, causing Drew to forgive him. While playing in the semi-finals, 
            Big Fella suddenly has a heart attack and is taken to the hospital. Betty Lou arrives but instead of chasti
            sing Preacher, she agrees to fill in as the team's fifth member.
            
            Dax and his team, now renamed the Harlem Buckets, play against Mookie's tea
            m in the finals who are an even match for them. Late in the game Lights and C
            asper collide and are both injured, forcing Dax and Mookie to fill in. Dax sti
            ll lacks self-confidence, but his teammates give him the advice he needs and he
             manages to make the game-winning shot, beating Mookie and earning everyone's re
             spect. Returning to the hospital the team reunite with Big Fella, Dax uses the pr
             ize money to pay his medical bills, and ESPN now hails Dax as a hero.</p>
